          <td>How many teeth did the tyrannosaurus rex have?</td>
          <td>60</td>
          <td>
            The Tyrannosaurus Rex typically had around 60 teeth, which were
            large, serrated, and designed for tearing flesh.

          <td>Which land predator was larger than the trex?</td>
          <td>Spinosaurus</td>
          <td>
            Spinosaurus was indeed larger than the T-rex. It was one of the
            largest carnivorous dinosaurs, with a length of up to 50 feet.

          <td>Cretaceous</td>
          <td>
            Velociraptors lived during the Cretaceous period, which lasted from
            about 145 to 66 million years ago. They were among the most
            intelligent dinosaurs and were known for their distinctive
            sickle-shaped claws.

          <td>Which dinosaur had the longest neck?</td>
          <td>Mamenchisaurus</td>
          <td>
            Mamenchisaurus had an incredibly long neck, with some specimens
            reaching lengths of over 30 feet. This adaptation allowed them to
            reach vegetation that other herbivores couldn't access.

          <td>What was the largest ancient marine predator?</td>
          <td>Mosasaurus</td>
          <td>
            Mosasaurus was one of the largest marine predators of its time,
            reaching lengths of up to 50 feet. Its powerful jaws and sharp teeth
            made it a formidable hunter in the oceans.

            Which ancient aquatic reptile resembled the loch ness monster?
          </td>
          <td>Plesiosaurus</td>
          <td>
            Plesiosaurus is often compared to the Loch Ness Monster due to its
            long neck and large body. However, Plesiosaurus lived millions of
            years ago and was a real creature, unlike the mythical Nessie.

          <td>Which one of the following is not an ancient marine reptile?</td>
          <td>Albertosaurus</td>
          <td>
            Albertosaurus was a terrestrial dinosaur, not a marine reptile. It
            lived during the Late Cretaceous period and was a close relative of
            Tyrannosaurus Rex.

          <td>
            The Portuguese Man O' War jellyfish is not a dinosaur but is
            considered one of the longest creatures ever existed in the sea. It
            has tentacles that can extend up to 165 feet in length.

        <tr>
          <td>What is the correct term for flying dinosaurs?</td>
          <td>Pterosaurs</td>
          <td>
            Pterosaurs were flying reptiles, not dinosaurs. They lived during
            the Mesozoic Era and were the first vertebrates to evolve powered
            flight. Their wings were made of skin stretched between an elongated
            fourth finger and their bodies.

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>What is the most well known Pterosaur?</td>
          <td>Pterodactyl</td>
          <td>
            Pterodactyl is one of the most well-known pterosaurs, although
            technically it refers to just one genus within the larger group of
            pterosaurs. Pterodactyls had long, toothed jaws and a wingspan of up
            to 33 feet.

        <tr>
          <td>Which is the largest known species of Pterosaur?</td>
          <td>Hatzegopteryx</td>
          <td>
            Hatzegopteryx was one of the largest known species of pterosaurs,
            with an estimated wingspan of over 30 feet. It lived during the Late
            Cretaceous period and was likely a formidable predator.

            How long could the biggest Pterosaurs be in the sky and at what
            altitude?
          </td>
          <td>8 - 10 days at 15,000ft</td>
          <td>
            The largest pterosaurs, like Quetzalcoatlus, could potentially stay
            in the air for extended periods, possibly up to 8 - 10 days. They
            likely flew at altitudes of around 15,000 feet, taking advantage of
            air currents and thermals.

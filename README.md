# DINOSAUR QUIZ

This is a simple dinosaur quiz that showcases the application of javascript, html, and css. It is an adaptation of a youtube tutorial by GreatStack who demonstrated how to create the starting blocks of a quiz. I have used this a starting point but then expanded upon to create what see you below in the screenshots.

The quiz consists of 3 main categories of land, sea, and air based dinosaur related questions where the user firstly inputs their name, presses start quiz to then enjoy answering the 12 questions, which have 4 multiple choice answers. At completion the quiz says well done "x" you have scored "x" out of 12. They are then offered to play again or go to more info, which will take them to a quiz answers and explanation page, that features a play again button to direct them back to the beginning.

## DEFENSIVE USER EXPERIENCE

This project set out to build an interactive front-end site that responds to users' actions, to allow them to actively engage with data, and alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals. Whilst reducing human error as much as possible and providing a smooth ride throughout the course of the interaction.

### TARGET AUDIENCE:

Given the simplicity and "easy-to-use" design. The quiz can be used as a fun educational tool for young children who may be studying prehistoric topics at school. Gamifying education is always beneficial for learning in a few ways 1. keeps engagement levels high 2. the scoring feature will entice children to improve upon their previous score 3. the score may also induce a competitive nature between their fellow friends and students.
